# This file defines what packages the project requires
# It is used when creating a virtual environment with pip
# It is not used when creating a virutal environment with 
# conda.  For that, check the environment.yml.  To create
# a virtual environment with pip on Windows, run the command:
# `python -m venv <environment name>
# `<environment name>/Scripts/activate.bat`
# `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# On mac/linux, the second line should read:
# `<environment name>/Scripts/activate.sh` 

# To leave the virtual environment, you need to run either
# deactivate.bat or deactivate.sh, also in the Scripts
# directory.

# Because different versions of packages behave differently,
# to make sure the project works the same for everyone, 
# you need to specify ("pin") the versions of each package.
# Yes, this means that someone may have many copies of each
# individual package, used for different projects, but that 
# is the accepted practice.  Think about it like different
# sized socket wrenches.
