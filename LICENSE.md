# License
If you're building an open-source project, you need to choose a license.
This file reflects that choice.
See [GitHub's guide](guide) or it's [blog post](post).

If you're building a project on time that you're charging, Booz Allen owns the
IC associated with it - it's that simple.  You can either use this 
section to state as such formally, or use it to describe to your
colleagues what you consider fair use of this project. In that way, this
section sort of works how the preamble on Booz Allen quals often
instructs the reader to ask for permission before using the qual.  It 
isn't legally binding, but enforces collegial norms.  That kind of info
can also go in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.

That said, if you do want work on a BAH project to go outside the wire,
there are two basic cases:

## Publishing with attribution to Booz Allen Hamilton
Booz Allen has its own [public-facing github page](bah).  If BAH wants
to demonstrate your work as a good example of the company's contribution
to open-source development, this is the route that you take.  This way,
both Booz and you get recognition for your work, as your public github 
profile will be the main contributor on the repository, but it will 
be on Booz Allen's page.

To pursue this route, contact _section under development_

## Publishing without attribution to Booz Allen Hamilton
If Booz Allen does not want to publish your work on it's page, you
still need permission to make your work public if it was made on company
time or with any company IC.
