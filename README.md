# DS5K to Python Data Science Developer
This package is an example of what a python package or project should include.
Each file includes comments to explain what it is for, how to modify it,
and other resources.  Not every file is necessary in every project.  Some files
may be more useful for building a python package (e.g. __init__.py), others for
applications (e.g. requirements.txt).  Regardless, you should be able to use 
the naked branch of this repo as a starting point for any python project.

## Installation
1. open Anaconda prompt
1. create a virtual environment (read requirements.txt or environment.yml)
1. If using as a package, type `pip install -e .` from the project directory.
1. Helps to use PowerBroker Admin sometimes.

## Prerequisites
* A basic knowledge of python (how to import modules, assign variables)
* A basic knowledge of programming (what a loop is, what a function is)
* Familiarity with an IDE (Jupyter doesn't count!)
 
## Self-guided tour order
1. This file
1. .gitignore
1. requirements.txt, environment.yml, and setup.py
1. \_\_init\_\_.py
1. basic.py
1. utils.py
1. test/test.py
1. docs/index.rst
1. LICENSE.md
1. CONTRIBUTING.md
1. vis.py

There's no need to look in the data/ and notebooks/ directories, as their contents
are gitignored.
